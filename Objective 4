4. Describe the syntax for declaring explicitly and implicitly typed variables, parameters, or function outputs.

Local variables, parameters, and function outputs can all be declared with any data types.
Only a value matching the data type declared can be assigned to them.
If no data type is declared when a variable is declared, its type becomes any.
If a value is assigned to a typeless variable, parameter, or function output as it is being declared, then the variables type will be inferred from the value assigned or returned.

Epic Conventions:
- For local variables, always infer the type unless an explicit type is required to avoid compile errors.
- Function parameters and return values should always have an explicit type.
