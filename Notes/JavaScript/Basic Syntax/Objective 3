3. Describe the data types in TypeScript and how they compare to their C# counterparts.

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, all types from JavaScript are supported in TypeScript.
TypeScript is also strongly typed like C# and has many similar primitives like Boolean, String, Number, etc.
New types introduced by TypeScript include:
- any : a variable that can take on any type, which disables type checking for that variable. (Similar to object in C#)
- enum : represents one of a predefined set of name numeric (like C#) or string values.
- void : used for functions that do not return any value (like C#)
