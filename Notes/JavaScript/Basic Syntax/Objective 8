8. Describe syntax for declaring a constant and the limitations on variables declared this way.

Constants in TypeScript are very similar to those in C# and are declared with the const keyword.
The value of a constant must be declared when the variable is declared (though the value can be computed at run-time).
Once declared, the value of a constant cannot be changed.
If the value of a constant is a reference type, like Object or Function, its properties can still be changed.
