1. Describe the format of TypeScript comments and how they differ from JavaScript comments.

Similarities:
Both JavaScript and type script support single line and block comments.
// single-line
/* block comment */

Differences:
They differ in how API documentation is done.

JavaScript uses XML comments like:
function myFunction(paramName) {
  ///<summary>Description of the function</summary>
}

TypeScript uses JSDoc-style comments like:
/**
* Description of the method or function
* @param paramName This is a parameter description
*/
function myFunction(paramName:any):void
{
}
