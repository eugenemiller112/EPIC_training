2. Explain how scoping a variable with let differs from scoping a variable with var and when to use each.

In JavaScript, the keyword var is scoped within the nearest containing function.
If it is not contained within that construct, the variable is global.
TypeScript supports a newer keyword, let, which is scoped in the nearest containing block of any kind.

If a variable has been declared with let outside of a block, attempting to redeclare it inside of a block using var will result in a compilation error.
This is because the two variables share the same scope. (Redeclaring inside the block with let will work.)
