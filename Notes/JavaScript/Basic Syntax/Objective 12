12. Describe the syntax for declaring an object type, including optional properties and index members.

It is possible to declare a variable that must conform to a specified object shape, including optional properties.
Only objects matching this object shape can then be assigned to that variable.
To permit properties beyond those allowed when the variable was declared, you may declare an index member, specifying its name, index type, and value type.
(The index type and value type must allow for all other existing properties in the object)
Any excess properties matching the index type and value type can then be included in the object assigned to the variable.
