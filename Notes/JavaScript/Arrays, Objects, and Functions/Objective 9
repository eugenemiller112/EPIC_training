9. (Closure) Describe the difference between a closure and non-closure function.

A closure is created when one function returns another.
This is significant because the the returned function must remember the variables that were available locally at the time the closure was created.
This is known as the closure's context.

function nonClosureFunction(a){
  ///<summary>This is a non-closure function that returns a closure function</summary>
  return function(b){a+b;}
}

var closureFunction = nonClosureFunction(5);
closureFunction(2); // returns 7

Notice that from the point it is created, closureFunction will always remember that the value is 5, since it is part of its context.
