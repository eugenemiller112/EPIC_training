5. (property deletion) Explain what happens when a property is deleted from an object.

The property is completely removed from the object. When trying to access the property that was deleted, undefined will be returned.
This is the same as if the property was never in the object.

Example:
function showProperties(obj){
  var str = "{"
  for(prop in obj){
    str += prop + ":" + obj[prop] + ",";
  }
  return str.length ==1?"}":str.substring(0,str.length-1)+"}";
}

var obj = {a:1, b:2, c:3};
showProperties(obj); // "{a:1,b:2,c:3}"
"b" in obj; // true
delete obj.b;
showProperties(obj); // "{a:1,c:3}"
"b" in obj; // false
typeof obj.b; // "undefined"
typeof obj.r; // "undefined"
