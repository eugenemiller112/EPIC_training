4. (new Array vs Square-Bracket Notation) Describe the difference between creating a new array using the keyword vs. using square brackets.

The only difference is superficial-the syntax between the two techniques:

var arr1 = new Array(1,2,3);
var arr2 = [1,2,3];
arr1 instanceof Array; // true
arr2 instanceof Array; // true

By convention, Epic prefers the bracket notation because it's more concise.
