1. (length property) Describe the difference between the length property of arrays and functions.

Arrays:
  With arrays, the length property describes the number of elements in the array, and is adjusted as objects are added/subtracted from and array.
  It does not affect the values in the array, only the position of the maximum value.
  Also, the length property can be set to adjust the elements contained in an array

  Example:
    var arr = [1, 2, 3]; // [1, 2, 3]  arr.length = 3
    delete arr[2]; // [1, 2, ]  arr.length = 2
    arr[5] = "test"; // [1, 2, , , , "test"]  arr.length = 6
    arr.length = 2; // [1, 2] arr.length = 2


Functions:
  With functions, the length property represents the number of named parameters.

  Example:
    var myFunction = function(a,b,c){}; // myFunction.length = 3

  Setting the length of a function has no effect

  Note: remember that you can pass more arguements than parameters to a function.
  Additional arguements can be accessed through the arguements array.
