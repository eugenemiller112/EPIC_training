17. (try-catch-finally) Describe the difference between the try, catch, and finally keywords and explain how they are used.
All three keywords are used when dealing with errors. Errors are thrown using the following syntax:
throw new Error("message");

Use try around code that could throw an error, and catch to capture that error and respond to it.
try{
  throw new Error("message"):
}
catch(error){
  console.log("There was an error:" + error.message);
}

If there is code that must run regardless of an error, include it with finally
try{
  throw new error("message");
}
catch(error){
  console.log("There was an error:" + error.message);
}
finally{
  console.log("Code that will run"); // this will always run
}

Note: There are other kinds of errors. Use instanceOf keyword to check for different kinds of errors. Examples include:
- EvalError
- RangeError
- ReferenceError
- SyntaxError
- TypeError
- URIError
