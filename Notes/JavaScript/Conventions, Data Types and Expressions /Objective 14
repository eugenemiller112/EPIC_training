14. (While Loops) Describe the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop.
The while loop checks the condition before the first iteration:
while(false){
  document.write("I will not execute");
}

The do-while loop executes the first iteration, then checks the condition:
do{
  document.write("I will execute once");
} while(false);
