13. (Concatenation) Explain what happens when you use the "+" and "+=" operators with strings.
When the "+" operator is used with either a string as either operand, both operands will be converted to a string and concatenated together.

Example:
"abc" + 123; // result: "abc123"
"abc" + true; // result: "abctrue"
"abc" + null; // result: "abcnull"
"abc" + undefined; // result: "abcundefined"
"abc" + {}; // result: "abc[object Object]"

The add assign operator "+=" also concatenates, but additionally assigns the result to the left hand operand.
