1. (Data Types) List the built-in data types of JavaScript. Next, describe the difference between weak and strong typing, specify which JavaScript uses.

Data Types:

Boolean
- true or false

Number (decimal, hexidecimal, exponential)
- 0x##, 0xFF (hexidecimal)
- #e#, 4.18e10 (exponential)
-  NaN, Infinity (not a number, positive infinity)

String (use escape \ for special characters)
- \' single quote
- \" double quote
- \\ backslash
- \n new line
- \t tab
- \x## Latin-1 character (## in hex)
- \u#### Unicode-1 character (#### in hex)

Object (unordered collection key/value pairs)
- Key is a string or number
  - key is also referred to as property
- Value can be any data type
- {} is an empty object
- null is a special object indicating no value
- Example:(name: "John Doe", id: 12345)

Function (like an object but also contains a collection of executible code)
- () operator that executes the code

Array (A special object that contains an ordered collection of key/value pairs)
- Key is an integer starting at 0
- [] is an empty Array
- Example: ["a", "b", "c", 123]

Undefined (Data type of uninitialized variables)
- Different from null (must assign null)

Weak typing (used by JavaScript) means that a variable can contain any type of data. Strong typing means a variable can only contain one type of data.
