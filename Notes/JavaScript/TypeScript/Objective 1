1. Explain what happens when a TypeScript file is compiled.

As TypeScript is compiled, the language service verifies that the code doesn't have any syntax errors.
Next, JavaScript code that meets the EMCAScript standard is omitted, along with a .js.map file that allows a debugger to present the original TypeScript code when debugging.

Note: The EMCAScript version used depends on browser target and version.
For example, if Chrome and IE11 are both targeted and Chrome supports EMCAScript version 6, but IE11 only supports version 5, then EMCAScript version 5 must be the target.

Because TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript and not machine code; the term transpiled is often used instead of compiled.
