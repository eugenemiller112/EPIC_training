3. Describe the kinds of TypeScript features that may be included in HyperspaceWeb code.

There are three kinds of advanced TypeScript features:
- Approved
- Not Approved
- Not Evaluated

You should not use any language features not explicitly Approved.
If a new feature is not listed in any of these categories, assume it has not been evaluated yet.
